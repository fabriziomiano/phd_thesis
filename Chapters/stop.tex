\epigraph{\emph{In God we trust. All others must bring data.}}{William E. Deming}

	In this chapter the core of this thesis will be presented, namely the search for the direct pair-production of the supersymmetric partner of the top quark in all-hadronic final states using a dataset of $36.1\, \ifb$ \pp\ collisions, at a centre-of-mass energy $\rts = 13$ \TeV, delivered by the \ac{LHC} and collected by the \ac{ATLAS} detector. %A dataset of $36.1\, \ifb$ was used. Such measured value of integrated luminosity has an uncertainty of 3.2\% based on studies of scans of the $x-y$ beam separation carried out on both $2015$ and $2016$ datasets, where the average pileup parameter $\mu$ was $13.7$ and $24.9$, respectively.
		
	The results produced were published in a paper in the Journal of High Energy Physics in September 2017~\cite{stop0L}. A previous version of the analysis was also made public, using $13.3\,\ifb$ collected at $\rts = 13$ \TeV, with an earlier subset of the whole $2015+2016$ dataset, documented in an ATLAS conference note~\cite{ICHEPstop0L}. Although both versions contain author's contributions, only the results of the most recent analysis will be hereby discussed, as it represents the most updated, improved and extended version. Specifically, the optimisation of the search strategy, as well as the data-driven estimation of the number of events in the search regions for one of the most important backgrounds, and the evaluation of the related theory uncertainties, characterised the author's contributions. In addition, exception made for the optimisation strategy, the same contributions were also used in a different \ac{SUSY} analysis published in October 2017 in~\cite{DMhf}. Further details can be found in Appendix~\ref{ch:appA}.

	The chapter will be structured as it follows: an excursus on the simplified \ac{SUSY} models considered will be presented in Section~\ref{sec:susysig}; the objects used in both data and \ac{MC} will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:obj_def}; the selection of the events, together with the key variables used and the optimisation of the regions in which the \ac{SUSY} signals were searched for will be presented in in Section~\ref{sec:evtsel}; the nominal procedure used for the background estimation will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bkgest}, with particular focus on the data-driven background estimation in Section~\ref{sec:ddbkgest}; the results, together with their interpretation, will finally be presented in Section~\ref{sec:results}.


	\section{SUSY Signals}
	\label{sec:susysig}

		As already introduced in Section~\ref{sec:SUSYPheno}, the signals considered in this work are generated using simplified models, meaning that only the \stop, the \ninoone, the \ninotwo, and the \chinoonepm, were the \ac{SUSY} particles considered. In particular, in such models, either \ninotwo\ or \chinoonepm\ is assumed to be the \ac{NLSP} and, the chargino-neutralino mass splitting $\Delta m(\chinoonepm, \ninoone)$ is assumed to be $1$ \GeV, in accordance with the naturalness argument. This implies that the \chinoonepm\ will promptly decay to $\Wboson^*\ninoone$ , with the \Wboson\ emitted as a virtual particle. The decay products of the so-created virtual \Wboson\ will therefore be low \pt\ objects which will not be reconstructed by the \ac{ATLAS} detector. 

		\subsection{Benchmark processes}

			\end{figure}

			Figure~\ref{fig:stopModels}(a)$-$(c) shows the diagrams corresponding to the decay scenarios considered in this work. In particular, (a) where both top squarks decay\footnote{The symbol (*) indicates off-shell production} via $\stop\rightarrow t^{(*)}\ \ninoone$; (b) where at least one of the stops decays via $\stop\rightarrow b\ \chinoonepm \rightarrow b\ \Wboson^{(*)}\ \ninoone$; (c) where $m_{\ninotwo}$ is small enough to allow one stop to decay via $\stop\to t\ \ninotwo \to h/Z\ \ninoone$ where $h$ is the \ac{SM} Higgs boson;

				\caption{Diagram of the gluino-mediated top squark production. The term ``soft" refers to decay products whose transverse momenta are below the detector thresholds.}
				\label{fig:gtt}
			\end{wrapfigure}

			The results were interpreted in the simplified models where only one- and two-step decays scenarios are allowed and, as already mentioned, the latter will be referred to as a natural \ac{SUSY}-inspired mixed grid, \ie\ $\Delta m(\chinoonepm, \ninoone) = 1 \GeV$~\cite{Alwall:2008ve, Alwall:2008ag, Alves:2011wf}. Furthermore, in both scenarios the \ac{LSP} is considered to be a pure bino state. The results will also be interpreted in two slices of the \ac{pMSSM} models: wino-\ac{NLSP} and well-tempered neutralino \ac{pMSSM}~\cite{Djouadi:1998di, Berger:2008cq}.
			A fourth scenario, in addition to direct pair production, was considered: top squarks can also be indirectly produced via gluino decays, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:gtt}. In such model, the mass difference between the top squark and the neutralino is considered to be relatively small, $\Delta m(\stopone, \ninoone) = 5$ \GeV, allowing the jets originating from \stopone\ decay to have a \pt\ below the reconstruction threshold of the \ac{ATLAS} detector resulting in an experimental signature nearly equivalent to the one in Figure~\ref{fig:stopModels}(a).


		\subsection{MC samples}

			A grid of points across the $(\mstopone-\mninoone)$ plane with a $50$-\GeV\ spacing is generated to simulate the above-mentioned simplified models. %The mixing between the partners of the left- and right-handed top quarks is assumed to be maximal, \ie\ ..
			The signal models were generated using \texttt{MG5\_aMC@NLO 2.2-2.4}~\cite{madgraph} interfaced to \texttt{PYTHIA8}~\cite{pythia8} for the \ac{PS} and hadronisation. \texttt{EvtGen 1.2.0}~\cite{evtGen} was employed for the decays of the  $b$- and $c$-hadrons. The tree-level \ac{ME} calculation includes the emission of up to two additional partons for all signal samples. The \texttt{NNPDF2.3LO} \ac{PDF}~\cite{PDFs} set was used to generate the signal samples with the \verb+A14+~\cite{CT10} tune for the \ac{UE} and shower parameters. Additionally, the \ac{CKKW} prescription~\cite{CKKW} was used for the \ac{ME}â€“\ac{PS} matching. 

			The various signal cross sections were all calculated to next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, with the addition of soft-gluon emission re-summation at next-to-leading-logarithm accuracy (NLO+NLL)~\cite{Beenakker:1997ut, Beenakker:2010nq, Beenakker:2011fu}. The sparticle mass spectra for \ac{pMSSM} models were calculated using \texttt{Softsusy 3.7.3}~\cite{Allanach:2001kg, Allanach:2013kza} while the decays of each sparticle were performed by \texttt{HDECAY 3.4}~\cite{hdecay} and \texttt{SDECAY 1.5/1.5a}~\cite{sdecay}. Finally, various \ac{PDF} sets, factorisation, and re-normalisation scales were used to generate an envelope of cross-section predictions, within which a nominal value and uncertainty were chosen. Further details can be found in~\cite{Borschensky:2014cia}.


	\section{Objects definition}
	\label{sec:obj_def}
			
		The physics objects, as output of the reconstruction algorithms discussed in Section~\ref{sec:objReco}, are required to pass a first loose selection to be categorised as \emph{baseline} objects. An additional procedure is employed, to remove potentially overlapping objects, \eg\ a lepton is identified as a jet, or a lepton that falls within the same jet cone. The so-called \ac{OR} procedure, whose inputs are two baseline objects, is employed to resolve such ambiguity by discarding on of the two objects by looking at their $\Delta R$ as shown in Table~\ref{tab:OR}. 

		\begin{table}[!htb]\centering\caption{List of the possible ambiguities with relative criteria and decisions.}
		\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
			\begin{tabular}{lccc}
				\toprule 
				\textbf{Ambiguity} & \textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Object kept} & \textbf{Object removed}\\
				\toprule
				\multirow{2}{*}{electron/jet} & $\Delta R (e,\mathrm{jet}) < 0.2$ & electron & jet\\
				& $0.2 \leq \Delta R (e,\mathrm{jet}) < 0.4$ & jet & electron \\\midrule
				electron/\bj & $\Delta R (e,\bj) < 0.2$ & \bj\ & electron\\ \midrule
				\multirow{2}{*}{muon/jet} & $\Delta R (\mu,\mathrm{jet}) < 0.4$ and & \multirow{2}{*}{muon} & \multirow{2}{*}{jet} \\ 
						& $N_{\mathrm{tracks}} < 3$, $\pt^{\mathrm{track}} > 500$ \MeV &  &  \\ \midrule
				photon/electron & $\Delta R (e,\gamma) < 0.4$ & electron & photon\\ 
				photon/muon & $\Delta R (\mu,\gamma) < 0.4$ & muon & photon\\ 
				photon/jet & $\Delta R (\mathrm{jet}, \gamma) < 0.4$ & jet & photon\\ 
				\bottomrule
				\end{tabular}
				\label{tab:OR}
		\end{table}

		The data-driven estimation of \ttZ\ events using \ttgamma\ is the only part of the analysis that used reconstructed photons. In particular, the \ac{OR} is modified accordingly to avoid that an object will appear in multiple collections (double-counting). The various baseline and signal objects can now be defined as it follows:

		\begin{description}
			\item[Electrons] 
				baseline electrons are required to have $\abseta < 2.47$, $\pT > 7$ \GeV\ and have to pass a variant of the \texttt{VeryLoose} likelihood-based selection (further details in~\cite{egamma, egamma2}). Electron candidates which pass the \ac{OR}, have a $\pt > 20$ \gev\ ($\pt > 28$ \GeV) in regions with a \met\ (lepton) trigger, satisfy $d_0/\sigma_{d_{0}} < 5$, $z_0 \sin \theta < 0.5$, and pass a \texttt{Tight} likelihood-based selection isolation, are tagged as signal;

			\item[Muons] 	
				baseline muons have to pass a \texttt{Loose} selection~\cite{PERF-2015-10}, satisfy $\abseta < 2.7$ and $\pt > 6$ \GeV. Further requirements are imposed on muon candidates to tag them as signal. In particular, they have to pass the \ac{OR}, a \texttt{Medium} quality selection~\cite{PERF-2015-10}, and satisfy
				$|d_0|< 3 \sigma_{d_0}$ and $|z_0 \times \sin \theta |<0.5$. Additionally, the \pt\ requirement is tightened up to $20$ \gev\ ($28$ \GeV) in regions with a \met\ (lepton) trigger;

			\item[Photons]
				baseline photons have to pass a \texttt{Tight}~\cite{Aaboud:2016yuq} selection, and have $\pt > 25$ \GeV\ and $\abseta < 2.37$. Additionally, baseline photon candidates are required to have $\pt > 130$ \GeV\ and satisfy a tighter isolation selection, in order to be tagged as signal;
			
			\item[Jets]
				as already mentioned in Chapter~\ref{sec:objReco}, jets are reconstructed using the \antikt\ algorithm with $R=0.4$. Baseline jets are required to have $\pt>20$ \GeV\ and $\abseta< 4.8$. Signal jets have to pass the \ac{OR}, satisfy the \ac{JVT} requirement, and have $\abseta < 2.8$ and $\pt > 20$ \GeV. 

			\item[b-tagged jets]
				baseline jets in the event are identified as originating from the decay of a $b$-quark is based on the \texttt{MV2c10} jet tagger which uses the a $77\%$ fixed-cut WP. The \pt\ threshold applied to signal jets is also applied to \bj\ and the requirement on the pseudorapidity is relaxed down to $\abseta < 2.5$.
			
			\item[Missing transverse energy]
				The \met\ is reconstructed as described in Section~\ref{sec:objReco}. Baseline muons, electrons, and jets after overlap removal are used in the \met\ recalculation. 
				% The \textit{soft} term in the event, already introduced in Section~\ref{sec:objReco}, that is not associated with any of the selected objects is calculated from inner detector tracks with $\pt > 400$ \MeV\ matched to the \ac{PV} to make it more resilient to pileup contaminations. 

				Additionally, in the analysis carried out during Run-1~\cite{stop0LRun1} another \met-related quantity was introduced. The track-based \met, derived from the sum of the \pt\ of the tracks associated with the objects in the event was found to have discriminating power to reject fake \met. The \ptmisstrk, whose magnitude is \mettrk, from the tracking system is computed using the vector sum of the reconstructed inner detector tracks, $\ptmisstrk = \sum_i^{\mathrm{tracks}} \pt^i$, with $\pT > 500$ \MeV\ and $\abseta < 2.5$, that are associated with the \ac{PV} in the event. 
 		\end{description}

		Ultimately, leptons are also required to satisfy \pt-dependent track- and calorimeter-based isolation criteria. The calorimeter-based isolation is determined by taking the ratio of the sum of energy deposits in a cone of $R = 0.2$ around the electron or muon candidate and the energy deposits associated with the electron and muon. The track-based isolation is estimated in a similar way but using a variable cone size with a maximum value of $R = 0.2$ for electrons and $R = 0.3$ for muons. An isolation requirement is made that is $95\%$ efficient for electron or muon candidates with $\pt = 25$ \GeV\ and $99\%$ for candidates with $\pt = 60$ \GeV.


	\section{Event Selection}
	\label{sec:evtsel}

		A cut-and-count strategy is at the heart of the analysis here presented. Dedicated sets of discriminating variables are employed to isolate, where possible, the targeted signals from the main \ac{SM} backgrounds. Equally, background-enriched regions are defined to \emph{control} the modelling of such backgrounds. The number of events passing such selections is used as the main observable, to predict both signal and background processes either by means of \ac{MC} samples, or using data-driven techniques. In general, a combination of the two is employed. 

		The \ac{ATLAS} detector did not operate with the same conditions during $2015$ and $2016$, meaning that different triggers and objects (calibration parameters) were used. In order for \ac{MC} parameters to be modified consistently with what is done in data, \ac{MC} events are assigned a random number, which identifies an ATLAS run. This allows \ac{MC} events to be associated with specific data-taking periods such that their parameters are associated what is done in data and can be modified accordingly.

		\subsection{Triggers used}

			As previously discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:detector} and~\ref{ch:trigger}, physics events are recorded once they passed a certain trigger. In particular, a \met\ trigger is used to select events that fall in signal-enriched regions, \ac{SR}, where $0$ leptons ($\ell$) are required; a single-lepton (photon) trigger is used for background-enriched regions, where $1$-lepton (photon) is required. A breakdown of all the lowest unprescaled online triggers used will be presented below;

			\begin{description}
				\item [Missing transverse energy] once the \met\ is reconstructed from an input jet collection, a $70$-\GeV\ threshold is required in the $2015$ dataset whereas, due to the increase in instantaneous luminosity (impact on the trigger rate), in $2016$ the threshold was gradually raised to $90$, $100$, and $110$ \GeV. It can be seen (Figure~\ref{fig:mettrigger}) that for analysis purposes a cut of at least $200$ \GeV\ is required to stay in a region where the trigger is fully efficient (\emph{plateau}); 

				\item [Single electron] events with an electron are triggered on using a logic \texttt{OR} of three chains. In particular, the first consists of a $24$-\GeV\ ($26$-\GeV) threshold, together with an \ac{L1} isolation, in $2015$ ($2016$) data; the second chain uses a $60$-\GeV\ threshold without additional isolation requirement; the third uses a $120$-\GeV\ threshold to be efficient at high \et; a $\pt^e > 27$ \GeV\ cut is applied to stay in the plateau region;

				\item [Single muon] a logic \texttt{OR} of two chains is instead used to trigger events with muons; a first chain with a $20$-\GeV\ threshold is used in data $2015$ and $26$-\GeV\ threshold, together with an isolation requirement, in $2016$; a second chain with a $50$-\GeV\ threshold is employed for both $2015$ and $2016$ data; a $\pt^\mu > 27$ \GeV\ is applied to stay in the plateau region;

				\item [Single photon] unlike the lepton case, only one chain is used to select events with photons; a $120$ \GeV\ ($140$ \GeV) threshold is employed in $2015$ ($2016$). Additionally, in order to ensure full trigger efficiency a $\pt^\gamma > 150$ \GeV\ cut is applied.
			\end{description}


		\subsection{Event cleaning}

			In order to remove events where the a detector fault occurred, a set of offline cuts is applied. The first requirement for an event to be a good physics event, is the existence of a primary vertex with a minimum of two tracks, with $\pt\ > 400$ \MeV, associated with it. Once this is passed, the status of both \ac{ECAL} and \ac{HCAL} for that event is checked: if any of the calorimeters returned an error state, the event is discarded. In addition, to reduce and suppress the fake-jet contamination a \emph{bad jet} requirement is defined by introducing quality requirements on a variety of jet parameters, \eg\ the fraction of energy deposited in the different layers of the calorimeters, and the fraction of jet \pt\ measured by the tracks in the Inner Detector. Events containing bad jets that passed the \ac{OR} are discarded. Similarly, events containing baseline muon candidates, whose relative uncertainty on $e/p$ is larger than $20\%$, and which were found before the \ac{OR}, are discarded. This also applies to events containing those potentially cosmic muons which were not removed by the \ac{OR}.				


	\section{Standard Model Backgrounds}

		As already anticipated in Section~\ref{sec:SMlim}, there exists a wide variety of \ac{SM} processes whose cross sections are significantly larger than \ac{SUSY} signal ones. In order for the analysis to robustly target the desired signal the accurate modelling of such backgrounds is a fundamental part. The signal region definitions, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:SRs}, therefore need an accurate knowledge of the kinematical properties of both targeted signals and backgrounds whose modelling is strictly related to the sensitivity reached by the analysis. Such backgrounds, with their relative \ac{MC} samples employed, which contribute to the search of direct stop-pair production in final states with jets and \met, will be discussed below using information taken from the Particle Data Group~\cite{PDG}.

		\begin{description}

			\item [Top pairs production:] \ttbar\ production is a major background for many third-generation \ac{SUSY} analyses at the LHC. The dominant top-quark decay is $t \to b \Wboson$ with a \ac{BR} of $\sim 99.8\%$, which in turn yields two oppositely charged \bjs\ and \Wboson\ bosons which will then yield $0$-lepton, $1$-lepton, and $2$-lepton final states with $45.7\%$, $43.8\%$, and $10.5\%$ \acp{BR} respectively, giving the name to the fully hadronic, semi-leptonic, and di-leptonic \ttbar\ decays, respectively; 
			
			\item [Single top production:] the production of one single top is also possible at the LHC. The different decays are usually referred to as $s$-channel, $t$-channel, and $\Wboson\ t$ channel, the last one being the most relevant for this analysis since it yields a \Wboson; 

			\item [$\mathbf{\Zboson}$ boson production in association with jets:] the production of a \Zboson\ boson in association with jets is a major backgrounds in both $0$-lepton plus \met\ and $2$-lepton final states because of the $\Zboson \to \nu \nu$ and the $\Zboson \to \ell \ell$ decays\footnote{$\ell = e,\mu,\tau$}, with a \ac{BR} of $\sim 20\%$ and $\sim 10\%$, respectively. On the other hand, although the hadronic decay of the \Zboson\ boson ($\Zboson \to qq$) has the largest \ac{BR} ($\sim 70\%$), it is not relevant for third-generation \ac{SUSY} searches, as the multi-jet background dominates. The \Zjets\ \ac{MC} samples are generated categorising\footnote{Using the information at truth level} the events depending on the flavours of the hadrons produced in association with the \Zboson\ boson:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $b$-filtered: containing at least one $b$-hadron;
				\item $c$-filtered: containing at least one $c$-hadron (no $b$-hadrons);
				\item light-filtered: no $b$- or $c$-hadrons included;
			\end{itemize} 
			In this analysis the major contribution to such background comes from the $b$-filtered sub-sample as the selected events contain \bjs;

			\item [$\mathbf{\Wboson}$ boson production in association with jets:] the production of \Wboson bosons in association with jets is a relevant background in $1$-lepton final states, due to the $\Wboson \to \ell\nu$ decay which has a \ac{BR} of $\sim 32\%.$ The dominant hadronic decay of the \Wboson, $\Wboson \to qq'$, produces a multi-jet final state which, again, is irrelevant for this analysis. The \Wjets\ samples are equally categorised depending on the flavour of the hadrons produced in association with the \Wboson boson;

			\item [Di-bosons production:] albeit the production of pairs of bosons, \Wboson\Wboson, \Wboson\Zboson, and \Zboson\Zboson, can also be a source of background in channels with leptons or jets, depending on the decay mode of each boson;

			\item [Top pairs production in association with a vector boson:] the cross section of the production of top pairs in association with a vector boson or a Higgs boson is smaller than the processes considered thus far. Nevertheless, such background can be a prominent background for third-generation \ac{SUSY} analyses. In particular, the top-pair production in association with a \Zboson\ boson, with the \Zboson\ boson decaying to neutrinos, $\ttZ \to \nu \nu$, does represent an irreducible background for this analysis: it yields a final state with jets and \met\ which looks identical to the signal searched for. For such reason a data-driven technique is employed, where essentially the top-pair production in association with a photon \ttgamma\ is used instead. Further details on the method for its estimation will be given in Section~\ref{sec:ddbkgest}; 

			\item [Multi-jet:] the multi-jet production is the process with the highest cross section among the ones mentioned so far, and even though such events do not contain neither leptons nor \met\ they could resemble the signal due to either isolated but mis-reconstructed leptons or large measured \met\ due to detector resolution. Despite the low probability of such occurrence, the high rate of such background might generate a non-negligible contribution in a certain channel;
		\end{description}

		\noindent For most of the listed backgrounds, a set of additional sub-samples is generated in order to estimate the theoretical uncertainties associated with the generation of the process. The variations of, re-normalisation, factorisation, \ac{CKKW} matching scales, different \ac{PDF} sets or hadronisation models, are included.

		\subsection{MC samples}

			\ac{SM} background samples are generated using different \ac{MC} event generators: the production of \Zjets\ and \Wjets\ events are generated with \textsc{Sherpa}~\cite{Sherpa} using the \verb+NNPDF3.0NNLO+~\cite{PDFs} \ac{PDF} set and the \ac{UE} tune provided by \textsc{Sherpa} itself~\cite{Sherpa}l; \ttbar\ and single-top production are simulated with \textsc{Powheg-Box}~2~\cite{powheg-box} and interfaced to \textsc{Pythia}~\cite{Pythia2006} for \ac{PS} and hadronisation, with the \verb+CT10+~\cite{CT10} \ac{PDF} set. {\scshape MG5\_aMC\/@NLO} interfaced to \textsc{Pythia} for \ac{PS} and hadronisation is used to generate the \ttbar+$V$ and \ttbar+$\gamma$ samples at \ac{NLO} with the \verb+NNPDF3.0NLO+ \ac{PDF} set. The underlying-event tune used is \verb+A14+ with the \verb+NNPDF2.3LO+ \ac{PDF} set. For the estimation of \ttZ\ via $\ttgamma$, $\Wboson/\Zboson+\gamma$ processes are generated with \textsc{Sherpa}~\cite{Sherpa} using the \verb+CT10+ \ac{PDF} set, and finally, the same procedure is used for the generation of di-boson production events.


	\section{Signal Regions optimisation}
	\label{sec:SRs}

		The experimental signature for all signal topologies described in Section~\ref{sec:susysig} is essentially characterised by the presence of multiple jets, two of which are required to have passed the $b$-tagging selection, a significant amount of missing transverse momentum, and no leptons (electrons or muons).

		An initial overview of the five different sets of \acp{SR}, \SRA\ (SRA) to \SRE\ (SRE), employed to target each topology and kinematic regime, is given below: 
		
		\begin{description}
			\item [SRA] is sensitive to the production of high-mass \stop\ pairs with a large \stop--\ninoone\ mass splitting \dmstopnino. It is optimised for $(\mstopone, \mninoone) = (1000,1)$ \GeV\ signal point;
			
			\item [SRB] targets decays involving top squarks with high stop mass but with smaller \dmstopnino. It is optimised for $(\mstopone, \mninoone) = (700, 400)$ \GeV, and $(\mstopone, \mninoone) = (600, 300)$ \GeV\ signal points;
			
			\item [SRC] is designed for the so-called highly compressed region where, $\dmstopnino \sim m_t$ and it employs an \ac{ISR} to improve sensitivity to such decays. It targets various signal points \eg\ $(\mstopone, \mninoone) = (500, 327)$, and $(\mstopone, \mninoone) = (300, 127)$ \GeV; 
			
			\item [SRD] targets the $\stopone \to b \chinoonepm$ decay, with $\mchinoonepm = 2\mninoone$, where no top-quark candidates are reconstructed. It is optimised for $(\mstopone, \mninoone) = (400,50)$ \GeV\ and $(\mstopone, \mninoone) = (700,100)$ \GeV; 
			
			\item [SRE] is sensitive to highly boosted scenarios that can occur in gluino-mediated stop production and it is optimised for $(\mgluino, \mstopone, \mninoone) = (1700, 400, 395)$ \GeV\ signal point;
		\end{description}

		\subsection{Preliminary selection and discriminating key variables}
		\label{sec:vars_used}

			A \emph{pre-selection}, essentially a basic selection of candidate events common to all the \acp{SR}, is performed by applying trigger and event-cleaning cuts together with the requirement of a relevant set of physics objects according to the targeted experimental signature. The physics objects, reconstructed as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:objReco}, are used to build the various variables used to discriminate the \ac{SUSY} signal from the \ac{SM} background. The event selection is based on such variables some of which will be described below:

			\begin{description}
				\item[\boldmath $\HT$:] the scalar sum of the \pt\ of all signal \antikt\ R$R=0.4$ jets;

				\item[$\dphijettwomet$:] the difference in $\phi$ between the two leading jets (ordered in \pt) and \ptmiss. This variable provides a good rejection of events containing fake \met\ originating from \ac{QCD}, hadronic \ttbar, and detector resolution effects;

				\item[\boldmath $\mtjetimet$:] the transverse mass (\mt) between the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ jet and the \met\ in the event\\
					% A massless approximation is used for this and all following \mt\ variables:\\
				\begin{center}
					$\mtjetimet = \sqrt{2\ptjeti\met\left[1-\cos{\Delta\phi\left(\mathrm{\mathbf{\ptjeti}},\ptmiss\right)}\right]}$,
				\end{center}
				where $\ptjeti$ is the transverse momentum of the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ jet;

			A summary of the pre-selection cuts is shown in Table~\ref{tab:SRcommon}, where three groups of cuts are listed: the first, a \met\ cut of $250$ \GeV, to stay in a region where the trigger is fully efficient, as already mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:evtsel}; the second, a lepton veto\footnote{The event must contain exactly $0$ baseline electron candidates and $0$ baseline muon candidates}, together with a cut on the number of jets (at least four, ordered in $\pt > 80,\,80,\,40,\,40$ \GeV), at least one of which must be b-tagged, as signal events tend to have more energetic jets than the background, to select hadronic \ttbar\ events; the third, an angular separation between the azimuthal angle of the two highest-\pt\ jets and the \ptmiss, to reject events with mis-measured \met\ originating from \ac{SM}-background decays. In addition, in order to further reject these events, a requirement on \ptmisstrk\ to be aligned in $\phi$ with respect to the \ptmiss\ calculated from the calorimeter system, is employed.

			\paragraph*{Top quark mass reconstruction}

				In addition to the above-mentioned variables, another set of variables is needed in \acp{SR} targeting the pair production of $\stopone \to t + \ninoone$: the reconstruction of two hadronically decaying top quarks in the event using the jet \emph{re-clustering} algorithm, performed using the \antikt\ algorithm (with a larger distance parameter $R = 1.2$), fed with the calibrated \antikt\ $R = 0.4 $jet collection (further details can be found in~\cite{Antikt2008}). The highest- (second-highest) \pt\ re-clustered jet is chosen to be the first (second) top candidate. The best signal sensitivity is reached by using $R = 1.2$ and $R = 0.8$, for top and \Wboson\ candidates, respectively~\cite{stop0L,ICHEPstop0L}. The variables used are the masses of the $R=1.2$ and $R=0.8$ leading and sub-leading jets, indicated by \mantikttwelvezero, \mantikttwelveone, \mantikteightzero, \mantikteightone, respectively. Such variables help reduce the \ac{SM} backgrounds. %from QCD, \Wjets, \Zjets, and lepton + jets \ttbar\ backgrounds,
				The $\met$ value provides the highest discriminating power against \ac{SM} \ttbar\ production, as it results from the undetected $\ninoone$ neutralinos in the signal. In order to further reject $\ttbar$ events in which one $\Wboson$ boson decays via a charged lepton plus a neutrino two additional requirements are employed. The first is on the transverse mass (\mt) calculated from the \met\ and the $b$-tagged jet closest in $\phi$ to the $\ptmiss$ direction: 

				\begin{equation*}
					\mtbmin\ = \sqrt{2\,\ptb\,\met \left[1-\cos{\Delta\phi\left(\vecptb,\ptmiss\right)}\right]} > 200\,\GeV,
				\end{equation*}

				\noindent which ideally\footnote{without considering of resolution effects} has en end-point at the top mass value for the \ttbar\ background, as it can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:preselection}(b).

					  \label{fig:preselection}
				  \end{center}
				\end{figure}

			\paragraph{$\mathbf{\tau}$ veto}

				An additional requirement is applied to reject those events with semi hadronically decaying $\tau$-lepton candidates that are likely to have been yielded from a $\Wboson\to\tau\nu$ decay. In particular, events are rejected when they contain a non-$b$-tagged jet, within $\abseta < 2.5$, with fewer than $4$ tracks associated with it ($\pt > 500$ \MeV), and when the angular difference, in $\phi$, between the jet and \ptmiss\ is less than $\pi/5$. The systematic uncertainties associated to the $\tau$ veto were studied in a paper - to which the author did not contribute -, produced during a previous version of the analysis carried out during Run-1, and were found to be negligible~\cite{stop0LRun1}.



		\subsection{Optimisation strategy}

			The optimisation of \acp{SR} is a fundamental part of every cut-and-count analysis. The goal is to find the best combination of cuts to remove as many background events as possible while retaining the largest possible fraction of signal events. A set of dedicated discriminating variables is therefore employed in each \ac{SR}.

			In order to represent the discovery significance of the signal model targeted, a \ac{FoM} is employed. In counting experiments the significance gives an estimate of the probability that an observed event count in a signal region, could have been produced by the sole fluctuations of the backgrounds in that region. In particular the optimisation of the cuts, of which each \ac{SR} selection is comprised of, is performed by maximising the value of the so-called \Zn\ formula~\cite{Zn}, even though alternative significance definitions can be found on the market~\cite{sigHEP}. The \Zn\ formula, implemented in the \verb+RooStats+~\cite{2010acat.confE..57M} package within the \verb+ROOT+ framework~\cite{Brun:1997pa}, is widely employed in various \ac{SUSY} searches, and it can be written in a simplistic way as it follows: 

			\begin{equation}
				\Zn = \frac{N_\mathrm{sig}}{\sqrt{ N_\mathrm{bkg} + (N_\mathrm{bkg}\sigma_\mathrm{bkg})^2}}
				\label{eq:Zn_forumla}
			\end{equation} 

			\noindent Here, $N_\mathrm{sig}$, $N_\mathrm{bkg}$, and $\sigma_\mathrm{bkg}$ are the signal yields, background yields, and the relative systematic uncertainty on the background, whose value is generally assumed - in a conservative way - a priori. Equation~\ref{eq:Zn_forumla} essentially gives a general idea of what the discovery significance would be, given a certain number of events in a \ac{SR}, the Poisson error on the background $\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{bkg}}}$ and the systematic uncertainty $\sigma_{\mathrm{bkg}N_{\mathrm{bkg}}}$ on the background. Furthermore, there are additional criteria, such as the compatibility with more signal models or a more solid background estimation, that must be followed when \emph{freezing}\footnote{Once all the possible combinations have been investigated and a selection has been agreed upon, the \acp{SR} cuts are fixed in order to move onto performing extensive background studies} a \ac{SR}. The various \ac{SR} selections will then be defined taking into account the above-mentioned criteria combined with the highest value of \Zn. 

			A so-called \emph{blinding} procedure is employed to avoid any potential biases that may affect the analysers during the optimisation of the \acp{SR}. In particular, the number of events - in the collected data - that fall into a signal-enriched region is hidden until the modelling of the backgrounds falling into a \ac{SR} has been solidly tested.%\footnote{A procedure employed in many analyses in various disciplines: the number of collected-data events that fall into a signal-enriched region is hidden}
			
			


			\subsubsection*{Signal Regions A and B}

				As already anticipated, SRA and SRB are optimised to target $\stopone \to t + \ninoone$ decays, where the stop-neutralino mass splitting is above the top-quark mass. The fully hadronic $\ttbar$ decay yields six distinct jets and typically they can be reconstructed as six $R=0.4$ \antikt\ jets whose transverse shape is circular with a radius equal to the \antikt\ $R$ parameter. Unfortunately though when the two top quarks are produced with enough boost, precisely when their mutual distance is smaller than $2R$\footnote{in the $\eta$--$\phi$ space}, the top-quark daughter-jet one-to-one correspondence might no longer be true. For this reason the two top candidates are reconstructed by feeding the \antikt\ clustering algorithm~\cite{Antikt2008} with $R=0.4$ jets, using re-clustered radius parameters of $R=0.8$ and $R=1.2$. Two $R=1.2$ re-clustered jets are required and the distribution of the leading $R=1.2$ re-clustered jet mass, for the main backgrounds and the signal, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:preselection}(a).

				\begin{figure}[!htb]
				  \begin{center}
				   \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/stop/SRA/CategoryDefs}
				   \caption{2D distribution of \mantikttwelvezero\ and \mantikttwelveone\ top candidate masses to illustrate the signal-region categories (TT, TW, and T0) in simulated direct stop-pair production samples with $(m_{\stop},m_{\ninoone})=(1000,1) \GeV$ after the pre-selection requirement. The black lines represent the requirements on the re-clustered jet masses~\cite{stop0L}.}
				   \label{fig:categories}
				  \end{center}
				\end{figure}

				The main discriminating variables are the re-clustered top masses, with $R = 1.2$ and $R = 0.8$, \mtbmin, \drbb, and \met. Events are grouped into three categories, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:categories}. The definition of each category is based on the number reconstructed top candidate, as it follows: 
				
				\begin{description}
					\item[TT] includes events with two reconstructed top candidates, namely with masses $\mantikttwelvezero>120\gev$ and $\mantikttwelveone>120\gev$;
					\item[TW] contains events with one reconstructed leading-\pt\ top candidate and one reconstructed sub-leading \Wboson\ candidate from the sub-leading $R = 1.2$ re-clustered mass \ie\ $\mantikttwelvezero>120\gev$ and $60<\mantikttwelveone<120\gev$;
					\item[T0] represents events with only a leading top candidate, \ie\ where $\mantikttwelvezero>120\gev$ and $\mantikttwelveone<60\gev$;
				\end{description}

				\noindent For the benchmark point $(\mstopone, \mninoone) = (1000,1)$ \GeV, after the pre-selection requirements, almost the totality of the events ($\sim 91\%$) fall into the three categories: TT=$38\%$, TW=$22\%$, and T0=$31\%$. Additionally, a  dedicated optimisation on each of such categories, due to differences in kinematics, is performed resulting in the three \acp{SR}, SRA-TT, SRA-TW, SRA-T0, defined in Table~\ref{tab:SRAB}. %Such categories are individually optimised as the signal-over-background ratio varies with them.

				An additional requirement in SRA is on the stransverse mass (\mttwo), especially powerful in the T0 category, as it assumes high values for signals with high top squark and low neutralino masses. \mttwo\ is particularly useful to reconstruct top candidate with lower momenta where the re-clustering was not optimal. In particular, \mttwo\ is built using direction and magnitude of the \ptmiss\ in the transverse plan and the direction of two top-quark candidates reconstructed using a $\chi^2$ method. The minimisation is done in terms of a so-called $\chi^2$-like penalty function $$\chi^2 = \left(m_{\mathrm{cand}} - m_{\mathrm{true}}\right)^2 / m_{\mathrm{true}},$$ \noindent where $m_{\mathrm{cand}}$ is the candidate mass and $m_{\mathrm{true}}$ is set to $80.4$ \GeV\ and $173.2$ \GeV\ for \Wboson\ candidates and top candidates, respectively. First, \Wboson\ boson candidates are formed by using single or pairs of \antikt\ $R = 0.4$ jets, and then combined with additional \bjs\ in the event to construct the top candidates. These, selected by the $\chi^2$ method, are only used for the momenta in \mttwo. The mass hypotheses are set to $173.2$ \gev\ and $0$ \gev\ for the top quarks and the invisible particles, respectively.	Further details on \mttwo\ can be found at~\cite{Barr:2003rg, LESTER199999}. Finally, in order to maximise the sensitivity to the signal, the top categories are then statistically combined - a logic \verb+OR+ of the three of them is taken - within SRA and SRB.

				Figure~\ref{fig:SRA_bkgcomp} shows the background composition in each of the SRA categories. The main backgrounds are \Zjets\ and \ttV, followed by \ttbar, \Wjets, and single top production. As it will be shown in Section~\ref{sec:bkgest}, dedicated \acp{CR} are used for the TT, TW, and T0 categories, in the regions where enough statistic is present. In particular, for the \Zjets\ background a set of three $2$-lepton \ac{CR} is used, while to control the \ttbar\ and \Wjets\ backgrounds two orthogonal sets of $1$-lepton control regions are used. As the $\ttZ \left ( \to \nu\nu\right)$ is an irreducible background, \ie\ it utterly resembles the signal searched for, its normalisation is instead obtained by using a $1$-lepton-$1$-photon \ttgamma\ \ac{CR}, as it will be shown in~\ref{sec:ddbkgest}.

				   \caption{Background composition in \SRA.}
				   \label{fig:SRA_bkgcomp}
				  \end{center}
				\end{figure}

				For the optimisation of SRB, a similar strategy was adopted. In addition to the \met\ and the re-clustered jet masses, the discriminating variables \mtbmin, \mtbmax, and \drbb\ are employed for the optimisation. After the pre-selection requirement, tightened up by the addition of the requirements of at least two \bjs, $\mtbmin > 200$ \gev, and the tau veto, the fraction of events that fall into the top categories is: TT=$14\%$, TW=20$\%$, TT0=$35\%$. The optimal cuts for SRB are also listed in Table~\ref{tab:SRAB}. 

				\begin{figure}[t]
				  \begin{center}
				   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/stop/piechart_SRBcomp}
				   \caption{Background composition in \SRB.}
				   \label{fig:SRB_bkgcomp}
				  \end{center}
				\end{figure}

				Similarly to SRA, Figure~\ref{fig:SRB_bkgcomp} shows the background composition in each of the SRB categories. The dominant backgrounds in SRB are \Zjets\ and \ttbar, with about equal contributions. As already discussed for SRA, the same \acp{CR} are employed to control such dominant backgrounds. The di-boson contributes for less than $1\%$ of the total background therefore no effort will be put in the design of a \ac{CR}. Furthermore, due to the large \met\ requirement, contributions from multi-jet background, are expected to be negligible in both SRA and SRB, nonetheless it will be estimated using the so-called \emph{jet smearing} method~\cite{calumThesis}.




			\subsubsection*{Signal Region C}

				\SRC\ targets a kinematic regime of direct top-squark pair production where the stop-neutralino mass splitting is around the top quark mass. The signature of such decays, when $(\mstopone, \mninoone) \sim m_t$, essentially consists of considerably softer jets and low \met. As it can be seen by looking at the background composition of such \ac{SR} in Figure~\ref{fig:SRC_bkgcomp}, this topology is very similar to a non-resonant \ttbar\ production which makes signal-background separation challenging. Nonetheless the presence of \ac{ISR} can help exploit kinematical differences between stop decays and \ttbar\ production. In particular, when the event is characterised by the presence of a high-momentum \ac{ISR} - reconstructed as an \ac{ISR} system formed by multiple jets - the system comprised of the two top-squarks is produced with a boost in the transverse plane.

				\begin{figure}[t]

				\end{figure}

				A new dedicated set of variables can be defined employing the so-called \emph{\ac{RJR}} of which a brief overview is given. Such technique is used to divide each event into hemispheres: an \ac{ISR} and a sparticle hemisphere. The latter is comprised of a pair of top-squark candidates both decaying via $t + \ninoone$. Objects are grouped together based on their proximity in the lab frame's transverse plane by minimizing the reconstructed transverse masses of the \ac{ISR} system and sparticle system simultaneously over all choices of object assignment. A dedicated set of kinematic variables is then defined, based on this assignment of objects to either the \ac{ISR} system or the sparticle system. This method is equivalent to grouping the event objects according to the axis of maximum back-to-back \pt\ in the event's \ac{CM} frame where the vectorial sum of all the \pt\ of the accepted objects is zero. In events with a high-\pT\ \ac{ISR} gluon, the axis of maximum back-to-back \pt\ approximates the direction of the \ac{ISR} and sparticles' back-to-back recoil. Additional details on such technique can be found in Ref.~\cite{RJR_ISR}.

				The ratio of the \met\ to the \pt\ of the \ac{ISR} system in the \ac{CM} frame of the entire (\ac{ISR} plus di-top-squark) system (\pTISR), defined as \rISR, is proportional to the ratio of the $\ninoone$ and $\stop$ masses and it is defined as it follows~\cite{An,Macaluso}:
				
				\begin{equation*}
					\rISR \equiv \frac{\met}{\pTISR} \sim \frac{m_{\ninoone}}{m_{\stop}}. 
				\end{equation*}

				\noindent Additionally, the following discriminating key variables are used in the optimisation of SRC: 

				\begin{description}
					\item[\boldmath \nBJetS:] number of \bjs\ associated with the sparticle hemisphere;
					\item[\boldmath \nJetS:] number of jets associated with the sparticle hemisphere;
					\item[\boldmath \pTSBZero:] \pt\ of the leading \bj\ in the sparticle hemisphere;
					\item[\boldmath \pTSFour:] \pt\ of the fourth-leading jet in the sparticle hemisphere;
					\item[\boldmath \dPhiISRMET:] angular separation in $\phi$ of the \ac{ISR} and the \met\ in the \ac{CM} frame;
					\item[\boldmath \pTISR:] \pt\ of the \ac{ISR} system, evaluated in the \ac{CM} frame;
					\item[\boldmath \mS:] transverse mass between the whole sparticle system and \met;
					\item[\boldmath \mV/\mS:] ratio of the transverse mass of the only the visible part of the sparticle system without \met and the whole sparticle system including \met;
				\end{description}				

				Table~\ref{tab:SignalRegionC} lists the selection criteria for SRC. Five different non-overlapping \RISR-based sub regions (windows) are employed, each of which targets different signal points, \eg\ SRC2 is optimised for $(\mstop, \mninoone) = (300,127) $ \GeV; SRC4 is optimised for $(\mstop, \mninoone) = (500,327)$. Additionally, a minimum of five jets are required to be assigned to the sparticle hemisphere of the event (\nJetS), and at least one of them (\nBJetS) must be $b$-tagged. Requirements on \pTISR, the highest-\pt\ \bj\ in the sparticle hemisphere (\pTSBZero), and the fourth-leading jet in the sparticle hemisphere (\pTSFour), are also applied. Furthermore, the transverse mass built from the sparticle system and the \met\ (\mS), is required to be above $300\GeV$. Finally, the angular distance in $\phi$ between the \ac{ISR} system and the \ptmiss\ in the \ac{CM} frame is required to be above $3$. As with SRA and SRB, the five $\RISR$ windows are statistically combined to improve signal sensitivity.

				\SRD\ targets direct top-squark pair production where both top squarks decay via $\stop\to b \chinoonepm$ and the chargino mass is set to be $m_{\chinoonepm}=2\mLSP$, therefore a nominal signature of six jets, two of which $b$-tagged. In this \ac{SR} no top-quark reconstruction is needed. 

				SRD is divided into two sub-regions, SRD-low and SRD-high, which are optimised for $\mstop = 400\GeV$ with $\mLSP=50\GeV$, and $\mstop = 700\GeV$ with $\mLSP=100\GeV$, respectively. As it can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:SRD_bkgcomp} the main backgrounds in SRD are \Zjets\ and \Wjets. The production of \ttbar, together with single top, and \ttV\ yield around the same number of events.

				\end{figure}

				In this \ac{SR}, at least five jets are required, two of which must be $b$-tagged. As previously anticipated, a cut on the distance between the two jets with the highest MV2c10 weights is required to reject event with two \bjs\ originated from gluon splitting. On top of the discriminating variables already discussed for the other \ac{SR}, the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the two jets with the highest MV2c10 weights (\ptbzero+\ptbone) together with the second (\ptone), fourth (\ptthree), and fifth (\ptfour) jet transverse momenta, are used as discriminating variables to provide further background rejection. Finally, tighter requirements on the leading and sub-leading jet $\pT$ are made for SRD-high. Table~\ref{tab:SignalRegionD} shows a summary of SRE selection.






			\subsubsection*{Signal Region E}


				Unlike the previous \acp{SR}, as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:susysig}, SRE is designed for signal models in which top quarks are produced highly boosted. The scenarios targeted by this \ac{SR} can arise from either direct pair production of high-mass stop quarks, or from the gluino-mediated compressed stop production with a large gluino-stop mass splitting. In this regime, re-clustered jets with $R=0.8$ are employed for the optimisation of the experimental sensitivity to such highly boosted top quarks. In particular, the signal point used for the optimisation is $m_{\gluino} = 1700 \GeV$, $\mstop=400\GeV$, and $\mLSP=395\GeV$

				Figure~\ref{fig:SRE_bkgcomp} shows the background composition in SRE. The main backgrounds are \Zjets\ and \ttV\ followed by single top, \Wjets, and \ttbar\ production. A dedicated $2$-lepton \Zjets\ \ac{CR} is employed for the normalisation of such background.  In this \ac{SR}, at least two jets out of the four or more required jets must be $b$-tagged. Additional discrimination is provided by the $\met$ significance: $\htsig$, where $\HT$ is the scalar sum of the $\pT$ of all the reconstructed $R=0.4$ jets in the event. The selection criteria for SRE, optimised for $m_{\gluino} = 1700 \GeV, \mstop=400\GeV$, and $\mLSP=395\GeV$, are listed in Table~\ref{tab:SignalRegionE}.

	\section{Nominal Background Estimation}
	\label{sec:bkgest}

		The implementation of \acp{CR} is needed in order to estimate the various background yields in the \acp{SR}, without relying solely on the yields that one would obtain simply by applying the \ac{SR} selection to the \ac{MC} simulations of a background process. The \acp{CR} selections are designed to be orthogonal selections to the \acp{SR}. For example, one would ideally design a \ac{CR}, such that it is fully dominated by the targeted process, therefore suppressing the signal contamination. This allows to derive a normalisation factor for each relevant background by rescaling the expected \ac{MC} yield to the observed number of data events in the corresponding \ac{CR}. The prediction of the yield of a targeted background in \ac{SR} is then rescaled accordingly. For example, consider the case of one \ac{SR} and one \ac{CR}. Ideally, if the \ac{CR} is 100\% pure, the expected background yield in \ac{SR} can be written as:
		\begin{equation}
			N_{\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{exp}} = \mu_{\mathrm{MC}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{MC}} \qquad \mathrm{with}\qquad \mu \equiv \frac{N_{\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{data}}}{N_{\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}
		\label{eq:exp_bkgyield}
		\end{equation}

		\noindent here, $\mu$ is the above-mentioned normalisation scale factor. Furthermore, a so-called \ac{TF} can be defined as the ratio of the \ac{MC} yields in \ac{SR} and in \ac{CR}, allowing the re-definition of the expected background yield in \ac{SR}, as it follows: 
		\begin{equation}
			N_{\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{exp}} = TF \cdot N_{\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{data}} \qquad \mathrm{with} \qquad TF \equiv \frac{N_{\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}{N_{\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}
		\label{eq:tf}
		\end{equation}

		\noindent This procedure allows a data-driven estimation of the expected background yields in \ac{SR} relying on the \ac{MC} simulation only for the computation of the \ac{TF}, and it is widely employed by several \ac{SUSY} analyses. Furthermore, it also allows to determine $N_{\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{exp}}$ with an uncertainty given by the Poisson error on the $N_{\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{data}}$ and the uncertainty on the \ac{CR}-to-\ac{SR} extrapolation. Unfortunately though, real life is not this easy, as in the actual \ac{SUSY} analyses, several are the background processes to be normalised in an independent set of \acp{CR}, and these usually suffer contaminations from other background processes. The above-mentioned equations then turn into something less easy to solve, for which statistical tools are needed. In particular, a system of $n$ equations (Equation~\ref{eq:mu_factors}), with $n$ number of background processes to control, is employed and needs to be solved to obtain the various normalisation factors:

		\begin{equation}
			\begin{cases}
				N_{\mathrm{CR,1}}^{\mathrm{data}} = \mu_1 N_{\mathrm{CR,1}}^{\mathrm{MC,1}} + \mu_2 N_{\mathrm{CR,1}}^{\mathrm{MC,2}} + \dots + \mu_n N_{\mathrm{CR,1}}^{\mathrm{MC,n}} \\
				N_{\mathrm{CR,2}}^{\mathrm{data}} = \mu_1 N_{\mathrm{CR,2}}^{\mathrm{MC,1}} + \mu_2 N_{\mathrm{CR,2}}^{\mathrm{MC,2}} + \dots + \mu_n N_{\mathrm{CR,2}}^{\mathrm{MC,n}} \\
				\dots \\
				N_{\mathrm{CR,n}}^{\mathrm{data}} = \mu_1 N_{\mathrm{CR,n}}^{\mathrm{MC,1}} + \mu_2 N_{\mathrm{CR,n}}^{\mathrm{MC,2}} + \dots + \mu_n N_{\mathrm{CR,n}}^{\mathrm{MC,n}} \\
			\end{cases}
		\label{eq:mu_factors}
		\end{equation}

		\noindent Here, $\mu_i$ is the normalisation factor for the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ process; $N_{\mathrm{CR,j}}^{\mathrm{MC,i}}$ is the number of event, taken only from the \ac{MC} simulation, that passed the $j^{\mathrm{th}}$ CR selection; $N_{\mathrm{CR,k}}^{\mathrm{data}}$ is the number of observed event in the $k^{\mathrm{th}}$ \ac{CR}. Such procedure is validated in so-called \acp{VR}, designed when the \ac{CR} are too far - in terms of parameters space - from the \acp{SR}. The purpose of \ac{VR} is to make a \emph{bridge} between the \acp{CR} and the \acp{SR} to avoid large extrapolations and avoid any potential biases hidden in the \acp{TF}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:extrapolation}. It is important to stress that \acp{VR} are expected not to yield any excess and match the \ac{SM} predictions within uncertainties. The data-\ac{MC} agreement in \acp{VR} represents a green light toward the unblinding of the blinded \acp{SR}.

		\begin{figure}[!htb]

		   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/stop/cartoon_CRVRSR_bw}
		   \caption{A schematic view of an analysis strategy with multiple \acp{CR}, \acp{VR}, and \acp{SR} using two observables. The \ac{CR}-to-\ac{SR} extrapolation is verified by employing \acp{VR} that lie in the extrapolation phase space (taken from~\cite{histfitter}.}
		   \label{fig:extrapolation}
		  \end{center}
		\end{figure}

		For the estimation of the major sources of background $1$-lepton and $2$-lepton \acp{CR} are employed. In particular, a $2$-lepton \ac{CR} is used for the estimation of the \Zjets\ background and a $1$-lepton \ac{CR} is employed for the estimation of \ttbar\ (CRT), single top (CRST), and \Wjets\ (CRW) backgrounds. Additionally, a dedicated set of variable is employed:

		\begin{description}
			\item[\boldmath $N_{\ell}$:] number of leptons in the event;
			\item[\boldmath $\pt^{\ell}$:] transverse momentum of the leading lepton;
			\item[\boldmath $m_{\ell\ell}$:] invariant mass of the \ac{SFOS} lepton pair in the event;
			\item[\boldmath $\mT(\ell,\met)$:] transverse mass calculated from the \met\ and the transverse momentum of the lepton;  
			\item[\boldmath $\metprime$:] the transverse momenta of the selected leptons are added to the \ptmiss, \eg\ to mimic the \Znunu\ decays in the \acp{SR}, forming the quantity \metprime. Essentially, this is a corrected version of \met\ to treat the leptons as neutrinos. The \emph{prime} notation is used for all the variables that depend on \metprime;
		\end{description}

		The background estimation strategy is based on five independent \acp{CR} to control \Zjets, \ttbar, single top, \Wjets, and \ttZ. Where enough statistics is available \acp{CR} are designed to estimate backgrounds in different kinematic regions of the \acp{SR}. A description of the nominal background estimation strategy is given below, except for the estimation of the irreducible background \ttZ, which will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ddbkgest} as a different technique is employed. The remaining backgrounds such as di-bosons and multi-jet are estimated directly using the yields obtained from \ac{MC} simulations.


		\paragraph{$2$-lepton \Zjets\ CR}

			The estimation of the \Znunu\ background is performed via the design of $2$-lepton $Z \rightarrow \ell \ell$ \ac{CR}. Although the branching fraction of the \Zll\ is smaller than \Znunu, a purer \ac{CR} can be obtained. As all the \acp{SR} (exception made for SRD) have requirements on the \MET\ selection, jet multiplicity, and $b-$tagged jets, therefore in order to ensure as little \ac{CR}-to-\ac{SR} extrapolation as possible, the same kinematic cuts are applied to the \Zjets\ \ac{CR} (CRZ).  SRA and SRB share a set of two \Zboson\ \acp{CR}: one is shared by the TT and TW categories due to statistical limitations and one is dedicated to the T0 category (CRZAB-TT-TW, CRZAB-T0). A common \Zboson\ \ac{CR} is used for SRDs (CRZD). Finally, a \Zboson\ \ac{CR} with higher \HT\ requirements is used for SRE. Essentially, a single-lepton trigger is employed, and a cut on $2$ \ac{SFOS} leptons is applied. To reduce the top contamination, an upper cut at $\met < 50$ \GeV, and a lower cut at $100$ \GeV\ are applied. Furthermore, a $\Zboson$-mass window cut on the invariant mass of the leptons pair is applied, to reduce other backgrounds contamination. A detailed \ac{CR} definition is given in Table~\ref{tab:selectionCRZs}


		\paragraph{$0$-lepton \Zjets\ VR}

			$0$-lepton \acp{VR} are designed to validate the background estimate for \Zjets\ in the \acp{SR}. Similarly to the strategy used in \ac{CR} dedicated sets of \acp{VR} are employed: VRZAB, VRZD, VRZE. No VRZ is designed for SRC due to the negligible contribution of the \Zboson\ background. In practice, to ensure orthogonality to the \acp{SR}, the requirement on one or more of the following variables is inverted: \drbjetbjet, \mantikttwelvezero, \mantikteightzero. A detailed list of the VRZ selections, after the common pre-selection shown in Table~\ref{tab:SRcommon}, is shown in Table~\ref{tab:selectionVRZs}. 

		\paragraph{$1$-lepton CR for \ttbar, single top, and \Wjets}
	
			For consistency with the \acp{SR}, the same \met\ trigger is used as in the pre-selection (Table~\ref{tab:SRcommon}). In these $1$-lepton \acp{CR} the lepton is treated as a non-b-tagged jet - to emulate the hadronic $\tau$ decays in the \acp{SR} - in the computation of all jet-related variables. Similarly to CRZ, CRT is then further divided to address the various \acp{SR}. %Additionally, the three sets of $1$-lepton \acp{CR} are orthogonal. 
			The requirements on the number of \bjs\ and on \mantikttwelvezero\ ensures that CRW is orthogonal with CRT and CRST. The selection on $\Delta R(b_{0,1},\ell)_{\mathrm{min}}$, defined as the minimum $\Delta R$ between the two jets with the highest b-tag weight and the selected lepton, ensures the orthogonality of CRT and CRST. In CRST the requirement on the $\Delta R$ of the two leading-weight b-jets is necessary to reject a large part of the remaining \ttbar\ background. Table~\ref{tab:selectionCRTs}  and Table~\ref{tab:selectionCRWST} provides the detailed definitions of the CRT, and CRST and CRW \acp{CR}, respectively. 

		\paragraph{$0$-lepton \ttbar\ and $1$-lepton \Wjets\ VRs}

			Following the same strategy discussed so far, in order to validate the \ttbar\ background $0$-lepton \acp{VR}, sharing the same common pre-selection, close to the SRA and SRB definitions are designed for each of the top categories: VRTA-TT, VRTA-TW, VRTA-T0, VRTB-TT, VRTB-TW, VRTB-T0. To ensure orthogonality with the \acp{SR} the \mtbmin\ requirement is inverted in all \acp{VR}. In particular, for the definition of VRTA, the SRA requirements are unchanged except for \mttwo\, which is not being applied, $100<\mtbmin<200\gev$, and the \met\ requirement being loosened by $100$ \GeV. The requirements for VRTB are the same as in the \acp{SR} except for \mtbmin, being changed to $100<\mtbmin<200\gev$ for VRTB-TT, $140<\mtbmin<200\gev$ for VRTB-TW, and $160<\mtbmin<200\gev$ for VRTB-T0. The VRTC keeps the same requirements as \SRC\ except for the looser requirements of $\mS> 100\gev$, $\pTSFour>40\gev$ and $\nJetS > 4$. The \dPhiISRMET\ requirement is inverted and $\mV/\mS<0.6$, where \mV\ is the transverse mass defined by the visible objects of the sparticle system and the \met, is applied in addition to the existing selection. The \ac{VR} VRTD, targeting SRD, is formed by applying the following requirements: $100<\mtbmin<200\gev$, $\ptbzero+\ptbone>300\gev$, $\ptthree>80$ \GeV, and $\mtbmax>300$ \GeV. All other requirements are applied exactly as in SRD-low except for the requirement on \ptfour\ which is not applied. Finally, VRTE, dedicated to SRE, ensures a minimum extrapolation as it applies the same requirements on the number of $b$-jets, \mantikteightzero, and \mantikteightone, and inverts the \mtbmin\ requirement to $100<\mtbmin<200\gev$. For the validation of the \Wjets\ background a unique $1$-lepton \ac{VR} (VRW) is used to test such background in all the \acp{SR}, with the only differences with respect to CRW being, \mindrblep, which is greater than $1.8$ in the \ac{VR} plus two additional requirements, namely $\mtbmin>150$ GeV and $\mantikttwelvezero<70$ \GeV\ which are included in the definition of VRW.

		The production of top pairs in association with a vector boson (\ttV) is the second most important background in most \acp{SR}. Precisely, such background is completely dominated by $\ttZ(\to \nu\nu)$, as the $\ttW(\to \ell \nu)$ contribution in \ac{SR} is negligible due to the presence of the lepton in the final state. As already anticipated in various parts of this work, $\ttZ(\to \nu\nu)$ yields a final state with kinematic properties identical to the signal searched for, namely two top quarks (six jets, if both tops are fully reconstructed) and \met\ from the neutrinos coming from the \Zboson\ decay. Unfortunately, as of today, although the \ac{ATLAS} collaboration has allocated some effort on this, no \ac{SM} measurement of such process has been published, especially due to the presence of large \met\ making the isolation of such signature quite difficult.

		The analysis carried out during Run-1~\cite{stop0LRun1} did not employ any \ac{CR} for such background, relying the estimation of its contribution in \ac{SR} solely on the yields obtained from the \ac{MC} simulation. For the analysis presented in this work, one attempt to isolate such background was made using a $3$-lepton $\ttZ(\to\ell\ell)$ \ac{CR}, one lepton from the semi-leptonic \ttbar\ decay and $2$ leptons from the leptonic decay of the \Zboson, although due to the large extrapolation on the number of leptons and the low statistics (low branching fraction to leptons), the design of a $3$-lepton \ac{CR} was dropped. Furthermore, a $2$-lepton \ac{CR} would suffer a large contamination from \ttbar\ and \Zjets\ backgrounds, therefore both methods were dropped and will not be further discussed.

		A data-driven technique, similar to the method adopted by another \ac{SUSY} analysis published in 2017~\cite{stop1L}, is employed instead. The normalisation of \ttZ\ in \ac{SR} is estimated by designing a $1$-lepton-$1$-photon \ttgamma\ \ac{CR}. Despite the differences in cross-section ($\sigma_{\ttZ}^{\mathrm{aMC@NLO}} \sim 150$ pb, $\sigma_{\ttgamma}^{\mathrm{aMC@NLO}} \sim 215$ pb), the validity of the technique is supported by the similarities of the \ttZ\ and \ttgamma\ Feynman diagrams, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ttZttGamma}. This \ac{CR} is designed to minimise the differences between the two processes and keep the theoretical uncertainties from the extrapolation of the $\gamma$ to the \Zboson\ low. 

		\begin{figure}[htpb]
		  \centering
		  	\subbottom[]{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/stop/ttZ}}
			\subbottom[]{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/stop/ttGamma}}
		    \caption{Diagrams of the production of top-antitop pairs associated with a \Zboson\ boson~(a) and a photon~(b).}
		    \label{fig:ttZttGamma}
		\end{figure}

		The strategy is based on the addition of the transverse momentum of the $\gamma$ in the event ($\pt^{\gamma}$) to the computation of the \met\ to mimic the neutrinos from the \Zboson\ decay. Additionally, in order to avoid double-counting of \ttbar\ simulated events where a hard photon is emitted, the \verb+MCTruthClassifier+~\cite{MCTruthClassifier} tool is employed to perform a truth-level selection of photons irradiated by a top quark. The same lepton triggers and lepton-\pt\ requirements are used for the \ttgamma\ \ac{CR} as for CRZ. Unlike the CRT, CRW, and CRST $1$-lepton \acp{CR} the lepton is not treated as a jet and unlike the CRZs the leptons are not removed from the \met\ calculation. In addition, an isolated photon with $\pt^{\gamma} > 150$ \GeV\ is required and it is used to ensure a consistent modelling of the \Zboson\ decay in the \acp{SR} as, for space-phase reasons, the two processes (\ttZ\ and \ttgamma) are comparable only when the \pt\ of the photon is well above the $\Zboson$ mass, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ZGammaratio}. Here, the \pt\ of the \Zboson\ and the $\gamma$, at truth level, are shown for the \ttZ\ and the \ttgamma\ \ac{MC} samples, respectively. The former is obtained by requiring a basic \ac{SR}-like selection with at least four jets two of which b-tagged, zero baseline and signal leptons, and a lower cut of $150$ \GeV\ on the \pt\ of the \Zboson, while the latter is obtained by requiring a basic \ac{CR}-like selection with at least four jets two of which b-tagged, $1$ lepton and $1$ photon, and a lower cut of $150$ \GeV\ on the \pt\ of the $\gamma$. Similarly to what is done for the \Zboson\ \acp{CR}, the photon \pt\ is used for the estimation of \met-related variables. Table~\ref{tab:CRTTGamma} shows the detailed selection applied. 

		\begin{figure}[htpb]
		  \centering
		  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{stop/Zgammaratio}
		  \caption{Ratio plot of the \pt\ of the \Zboson\ and $\gamma$ bosons at truth level obtained by requiring \ac{CR}-like and \ac{SR}-like selections as described in the text.}
		  \label{fig:ZGammaratio}
		\end{figure}

		The estimation of the \ttZ\ yields in \ac{SR} is based on an approximation of what was already shown in Equations~\ref{eq:tf} and~\ref{eq:mu_factors}:
		
		\begin{equation}
			N_{\ttZ,\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{exp}} \sim N_{\ttgamma,\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{obs}} \cdot \frac{N_{\ttZ,\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}{N_{\ttgamma,\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}} \qquad \mathrm{with} \qquad TF \equiv \frac{N_{\ttZ,\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}{N_{\ttgamma,\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}
		\label{eq:ttZ_estimation}
		\end{equation}

		\noindent where, $N_{\ttZ,\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{exp}}$ is the expected \ttZ\ yields in \ac{SR}, $N_{\ttgamma,\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{obs}}$ is the observed number of \ttgamma\ events in \ttgamma\ \ac{CR}, $N_{\ttZ,\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}$ is the number of \ttZ\ events falling into the \acp{SR}, and $N_{\ttgamma,\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}$ is the number of \ttgamma\ events in \ttgamma\ \ac{CR} taken from the \ac{MC} simulation. As previously mentioned, if the \ac{CR} were $100\%$ pure (no contamination of other background processes) Equation~\ref{eq:ttZ_estimation} would not be approximated, but exact.

		Table~\ref{tab:CRTTGamma_yields} shows the breakdown of the various processes entering into the CRTTGamma selection shown in Table~\ref{tab:CRTTGamma}. The purity reached $86\%$ and $\mu_{\ttgamma}$ is $1.29$. 



		Additionally the agreement between the observed data and the \ac{MC} predictions was checked in the \met\ and \mtlepmet\ distributions as the potential presence of fake leptons would show up at low values of \mtlepmet. The agreement at low \mtlepmet\ is a reasonable indication of no significant contributions from fake leptons.

		Finally, a $0$-lepton \ttgamma\ \ac{VR} was also considered but it was found to have a too low \ttgamma\ contribution, with \gammajets\ being the main contaminant and it was therefore dropped. Nevertheless, the use of the same kinematic selection in \ac{CR}  and \ac{SR}, together with the good data/MC agreement found in the main distributions gives confidence in the accuracy of the method.




	\clearpage\section{Summary of the background estimation}

		A summary with the all the detailed selections of the presented \acp{CR} is given in Tables~\ref{tab:selectionCRZs} (CRZ),~\ref{tab:selectionCRTs} (CRT), and ~\ref{tab:selectionCRWST} (CRW and CRST). Additionally, Tables~\ref{tab:selectionVRZs},~\ref{tab:VRTABDef},~\ref{tab:VRTCDEDef} show the detailed selections for the \acp{VR} of the \Zjets\ and \ttbar\ backgrounds in \ac{SR}, respectively. The details about the estimation of \ttZ\ are omitted as it has been extensively discussed in the previous Section.

The stacked histograms show the \ac{SM} prediction, normalised using scale factors derived from the simultaneous fit to all backgrounds, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:results}. Ratio plots displayed the ratio of data events to the total \ac{SM} prediction. The uncertainty band around the \ac{SM} prediction and in the ratio plot illustrates the combination of \ac{MC} statistical and detector-related systematic uncertainties. The rightmost bin includes overflow events~\cite{stop0L}.}

 		Figure~\ref{fig:VRs} displays the good agreement between data and \ac{MC} predictions, after a simultaneous fit procedure - which will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:results} - where the \acp{VR} are used as test \acp{SR}.

The stacked histograms show the \ac{SM} prediction and the uncertainty band around the \ac{SM} prediction shows the total uncertainty, which consists of the \ac{MC} statistical uncertainties, detector-related systematic uncertainties, and theoretical uncertainties in the extrapolation from \ac{CR} to \ac{VR}.}
