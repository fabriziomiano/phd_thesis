\chapter{The \emph{b}-jet Trigger Signature in ATLAS}
\label{ch:trigger}

% In this chapter the monitor and performance of the bottom-quark-initiated jet (\bj) signature trigger, this being the authorâ€™s ``technical/qualification task'' to become a qualified member of the experiment, will be discussed. The efficiencies of some of the Run 2 \bj\ triggers were evaluated using 3.8\ifb\ of \pp\ collisions data collected in 2015 with 25 ns bunch-spacing.
