	This chapter will describe the background-estimation strategy for the main backgrounds of this analysis, already introduced in Section~\ref{sec:SMbkg}, and will give an overview of the systematic uncertainties - both experimental and theoretical - relevant for the analysis carried out. In particular, Section~\ref{sec:bkgest} provides an overview of the main reducible backgrounds and how to model them; in Section~\ref{sec:ddbkgest} the estimation of the irreducible background \ttZ\ will be extensively discussed, as it represents one of the major author's contribution to the presented analysis; finally, the systematic uncertainties will be presented in Section~\ref{sec:syst_unc}. The author also contributed to another analysis - the search for Dark Matter produced in association with third-generation quarks - through the estimation of the irreducible background \ttZ, which, again, was an irreducible background, and this will be presented in Appendix~\ref{app:ttzdm}. 

	\section{Nominal background estimation}
	\label{sec:bkgest}

		The implementation of \acp{CR} is needed in order to estimate the various background yields in the \acp{SR}, without relying solely on the yields that one would obtain simply by applying the \ac{SR} selection to the \ac{MC} simulations of a background process. The \acp{CR} selections are designed to be orthogonal selections to the \acp{SR}. For example, one would ideally design a \ac{CR}, such that it is fully dominated by the targeted background process, therefore suppressing the signal contamination. This allows to derive a normalisation factor for each relevant background by rescaling the expected \ac{MC} yield to the observed number of data events in the corresponding \ac{CR}. The prediction of the yield of a targeted background in \ac{SR} is then rescaled accordingly. For example, consider the case of one \ac{SR} and one \ac{CR}. Ideally, if the \ac{CR} is 100\% pure, the expected background yield in \ac{SR} can be written as:
		\begin{equation}
			N_{\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{exp}} = \mu_{\mathrm{MC}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{MC}} \qquad \mathrm{with}\qquad \mu \equiv \frac{N_{\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{data}}}{N_{\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}
		\label{eq:exp_bkgyield}
		\end{equation}

		\noindent here, $\mu$ is the above-mentioned normalisation scale factor. Furthermore, a so-called \ac{TF} can be defined as the ratio of the \ac{MC} yields in \ac{SR} and in \ac{CR}, allowing the re-definition of the expected background yield in \ac{SR}, as it follows: 
		\begin{equation}
			N_{\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{exp}} = T_f \cdot N_{\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{data}} \qquad \mathrm{with} \qquad T_f \equiv \frac{N_{\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}{N_{\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}
		\label{eq:tf}
		\end{equation}

		\noindent This procedure allows a data-driven estimation of the expected background yields in \ac{SR} relying on the \ac{MC} simulation only for the computation of the \ac{TF}, and it is widely employed by several \ac{SUSY} analyses in \ac{ATLAS}. Furthermore, it also allows to determine $N_{\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{exp}}$ with an uncertainty given by the Poisson error on the $N_{\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{data}}$ and the uncertainty on the \ac{CR}-to-\ac{SR} extrapolation. Unfortunately though there are several background processes to be normalised in an independent set of \acp{CR}, and these usually suffer contaminations from other background processes. The above-mentioned equations then turn into something less easy to solve, for which statistical tools are needed. In particular, a system of $n$ equations (Equation~\ref{eq:mu_factors}), with $n$ number of background processes to control, is employed and needs to be solved to obtain the various normalisation factors:

		\begin{equation}
			\begin{cases}
				N_{\mathrm{CR,1}}^{\mathrm{data}} = \mu_1 N_{\mathrm{CR,1}}^{\mathrm{MC,1}} + \mu_2 N_{\mathrm{CR,1}}^{\mathrm{MC,2}} + \dots + \mu_n N_{\mathrm{CR,1}}^{\mathrm{MC,n}} \\
				N_{\mathrm{CR,2}}^{\mathrm{data}} = \mu_1 N_{\mathrm{CR,2}}^{\mathrm{MC,1}} + \mu_2 N_{\mathrm{CR,2}}^{\mathrm{MC,2}} + \dots + \mu_n N_{\mathrm{CR,2}}^{\mathrm{MC,n}} \\
				\dots \\
				N_{\mathrm{CR,n}}^{\mathrm{data}} = \mu_1 N_{\mathrm{CR,n}}^{\mathrm{MC,1}} + \mu_2 N_{\mathrm{CR,n}}^{\mathrm{MC,2}} + \dots + \mu_n N_{\mathrm{CR,n}}^{\mathrm{MC,n}} \\
			\end{cases}
		\label{eq:mu_factors}
		\end{equation}

		\noindent Here, $\mu_i$ is the normalisation factor for the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ process; $N_{\mathrm{CR,j}}^{\mathrm{MC,i}}$ is the number of event, taken only from the \ac{MC} simulation, that passed the $j^{\mathrm{th}}$ CR selection; $N_{\mathrm{CR,k}}^{\mathrm{data}}$ is the number of observed event in the $k^{\mathrm{th}}$ \ac{CR}. Such procedure is validated in so-called \acp{VR}, designed when the \ac{CR} are too far - in terms of parameter space - from the \acp{SR}. The purpose of \ac{VR} is to provide a \emph{bridge} between the \acp{CR} and the \acp{SR} to avoid large extrapolations and avoid any potential biases hidden in the \acp{TF}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:extrapolation}. It is important to stress that \acp{VR} are expected not to yield any excess and match the \ac{SM} predictions within uncertainties. The data-\ac{MC} agreement in \acp{VR} represents a green light toward the unblinding of the blinded \acp{SR}.

		   \label{fig:extrapolation}
		  \end{center}
		\end{figure}

		For the estimation of the major sources of reducible background $1$-lepton and $2$-lepton \acp{CR} are employed. In particular, a $2$-lepton \ac{CR} is used for the estimation of the \Zjets\ background (CRZ) and a $1$-lepton \ac{CR} is employed for the estimation of \ttbar\ (CRT), single top (CRST), and \Wjets\ (CRW) backgrounds. Additionally, a dedicated set of variable is employed:

		\begin{description}
			\item[\boldmath $N_{\ell}$:] number of leptons in the event;
			\item[\boldmath $\pt^{\ell}$:] transverse momentum of the leading lepton;
			\item[\boldmath $m_{\ell\ell}$:] invariant mass of the \ac{SFOS} lepton pair in the event;
			\item[\boldmath $\mT(\ell,\met)$:] transverse mass calculated from the \met\ and the transverse momentum of the lepton;  
			\item[\boldmath $\metprime$:] the transverse momenta of the selected leptons are added to the \ptmiss, \eg\ to mimic the \Znunu\ decays in the \acp{SR}, forming the quantity \metprime. Essentially, this is a corrected version of \met\ to treat the leptons as neutrinos. The \emph{prime} notation is used for all the variables that depend on \metprime.
		\end{description}


		\subsection{Control regions}
		\label{subsec:crs}

			The background estimation strategy is based on five independent \acp{CR} to control \Zjets, \ttbar, single top, \Wjets, and \ttZ. Where enough statistics is available \acp{CR} are designed to estimate backgrounds in different kinematic regions of the \acp{SR}. A description of the nominal background estimation strategy is given below, except for the estimation of the irreducible background \ttZ, which will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ddbkgest} as a different technique is employed. The remaining backgrounds such as di-bosons and multi-jet are estimated directly using the yields obtained from \ac{MC} simulations. A detailed description of all the selections employed for the estimation of the above-mentioned backgrounds can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:sumbkgest}. 

			\begin{description}
			%\paragraph{$2$-lepton \Zjets\ CR}

				\item [\Zjets\ CR (CRZ)] The estimation of the \Znunu\ background is performed via the design of $2$-lepton $Z \rightarrow \ell \ell$ \ac{CR}. Although the branching fraction of the \Zll\ is smaller than \Znunu, a purer \ac{CR} can be obtained. As all the \acp{SR} (exception made for SRD) have requirements on the \MET\ selection, jet multiplicity, and $b-$tagged jets, in order to ensure as little \ac{CR}-to-\ac{SR} extrapolation as possible, the same kinematic cuts are applied in CRZ. SRA and SRB share a set of two \Zboson\ \acp{CR}: one is shared by the TT and TW categories due to statistical limitations and one is dedicated to the T0 category (CRZAB-TT-TW, CRZAB-T0). A common \Zboson\ \ac{CR} is used for SRDs (CRZD). Finally, a \Zboson\ \ac{CR} with higher \HT\ requirements is used for SRE. The \acp{CR} are defined by using events passing a single-lepton trigger, and in addition requiring a cut on $2$ \ac{SFOS} leptons is applied. To reduce the top contamination, an upper cut at $\met < 50$ \GeV, and a lower cut at $100$ \GeV\ are applied. Furthermore, a $\Zboson$-mass window cut on the invariant mass of the leptons pair is applied, to reduce other backgrounds contamination. A detailed \ac{CR} definition is given in Table~\ref{tab:selectionCRZs}

			%\paragraph{$1$-lepton CR for \ttbar, single top, and \Wjets}
		
				\item [\ttbar\ CR (CRT)] As already mentioned, these \acp{CR} are all defined by using events required to pass a \met\ trigger. In addition, in order to emulate the hadronic $\tau$ decays in the \acp{SR} the lepton is treated as a non-$b$-tagged jet in the computation of all jet-related variables. Similarly to CRZ, CRT is then further divided to address the various \acp{SR};

				\item [\Wjets\ CR (CRW)] CRW, very similar to CRT, also employs a \met\ trigger, but here $1$ \bj\ only is required. In addition, a looser and inverted cut on \mantikttwelvezero, together with a requirement $\Delta R(b_{0,1},\ell)_{\mathrm{min}}$, defined as the minimum $\Delta R$ between the two jets with the highest $b$-tag weight and the selected lepton, ensures that CRW is orthogonal with CRT; 

				\item [Single top CR (CRST)] In CRST, also similar to CRT and CRW, two \bjs\ are required. Furthermore, the requirement on the $\Delta R$ of the two leading-weight \bjs\ is necessary to reject a large part of the remaining \ttbar\ background. 
			\end{description}

			%Ultimately, Tables~\ref{tab:selectionCRTs} and~\ref{tab:selectionCRWST} provide the detailed definitions of the CRT, and CRST and CRW, respectively.


		\subsection{Validation regions}

			To validate the estimation of the various backgrounds, \acp{VR} are employed where possible. In particular, the following \acp{VR} are defined:

			\begin{description}
			%\paragraph{$0$-lepton \ttbar\ and $1$-lepton \Wjets\ VRs}

				\item [\Zjets\ VR (VRZ)] $0$-lepton \acp{VR} are designed to validate the background estimate for \Zjets\ in the \acp{SR}. Similarly to the strategy used in \ac{CR}, dedicated sets of \acp{VR} are employed: VRZAB, VRZD, VRZE. No VRZ is designed for SRC due to the negligible contribution of the \Zboson\ background in this region. In practice, to ensure orthogonality to the \acp{SR}, the requirement on one or more of the following variables is inverted: \drbjetbjet, \mantikttwelvezero, \mantikteightzero. A detailed list of the VRZ selections, after the common pre-selection shown in Table~\ref{tab:SRcommon}, is shown in Table~\ref{tab:selectionVRZs}.

				\item [\ttbar\ VR (VRTT)] Following the same strategy discussed so far, in order to validate the \ttbar\ background, $0$-lepton \acp{VR} sharing the same common pre-selection close to the SRA and SRB definitions are designed for each of the top categories: VRTA-TT, VRTA-TW, VRTA-T0, VRTB-TT, VRTB-TW, VRTB-T0. To ensure orthogonality with the \acp{SR} the \mtbmin\ requirement is inverted in all \acp{VR}. In particular, for the definition of VRTA, the SRA requirements are unchanged except for \mttwo\, which is not being applied, $100<\mtbmin<200\gev$, and the \met\ requirement being loosened by $100$ \GeV. The requirements for VRTB are the same as in the \acp{SR} except for \mtbmin, being changed to $100<\mtbmin<200\gev$ for VRTB-TT, $140<\mtbmin<200\gev$ for VRTB-TW, and $160<\mtbmin<200\gev$ for VRTB-T0. The VRTC keeps the same requirements as \SRC\ except for the looser requirements of $\mS> 100\gev$, $\pTSFour>40\gev$ and $\nJetS > 4$. The \dPhiISRMET\ requirement is inverted and $\mV/\mS<0.6$, where \mV\ is the transverse mass defined by the visible objects of the sparticle system and the \met, is applied in addition to the existing selection. The \ac{VR} VRTD, targeting SRD, is formed by applying the following requirements: $100<\mtbmin<200\gev$, $\ptbzero+\ptbone>300\gev$, $\ptthree>80$ \GeV, and $\mtbmax>300$ \GeV. All other requirements are applied exactly as in SRD-low except for the requirement on \ptfour\ which is not applied. Finally, VRTE, dedicated to SRE, ensures a minimum extrapolation as it applies the same requirements on the number of $b$-jets, \mantikteightzero, and \mantikteightone, and inverts the \mtbmin\ requirement to $100<\mtbmin<200\gev$;

				\item [\Wjets\ VR (VRW)] For the validation of the \Wjets\ background a unique $1$-lepton $1$-\bj\ \ac{VR} is used to test such background in all the \acp{SR}, with the only differences with respect to CRW being, \mindrblep, which is greater than $1.8$ in the \ac{VR} plus two additional requirements, namely $\mtbmin>150$ GeV and $\mantikttwelvezero<70$ \GeV\ which are included in the definition of VRW. Further details

			\end{description}

		Ultimately, in order to determine the normalisations of the \ac{SM} backgrounds for \Zboson, \ttbar, \Wboson, single top, \ttZ, and their estimates, in each \acp{SR}, the observed numbers of events in the various \acp{CR} are included in a binned profile likelihood fit, which will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:stat_ana}. A simultaneous fit, to best match the observed data in each \ac{CR}, taking into account all the contributions from the various backgrounds, is performed to determine the \ac{SM} background normalisation factors. 


	\section{Estimation of the irreducible background}
	\label{sec:ddbkgest}

		The production of top pairs in association with a vector boson (\ttV) is the second most important background in most \acp{SR}. Precisely, such background is completely dominated by $\ttZ(\to \nu\nu)$, as the $\ttW(\to \ell \nu)$ contribution in \ac{SR} is negligible due to the presence of the lepton in the final state. As already anticipated in various parts of this work, $\ttZ(\to \nu\nu)$ yields a final state with kinematic properties identical to the signal searched for, namely two top quarks (six jets, if both tops are fully reconstructed) and \met\ from the neutrinos coming from the \Zboson\ decay. Unfortunately, as of today, although the \ac{ATLAS} collaboration has allocated some effort on this, no \ac{SM} measurement of such process has been published, especially due to the presence of large \met\ making the isolation of such signature quite difficult.

		%The analysis carried out during Run-1~\cite{stop0LRun1} did not employ any \ac{CR} for such background, relying the estimation of its contribution in \ac{SR} solely on the yields obtained from the \ac{MC} simulation. For the analysis presented in this work, one attempt to isolate such background was made using a $3$-lepton $\ttZ(\to\ell\ell)$ \ac{CR}, one lepton from the semi-leptonic \ttbar\ decay and $2$ leptons from the leptonic decay of the \Zboson, although due to the large extrapolation on the number of leptons and the low statistics (low branching fraction to leptons), the design of a $3$-lepton \ac{CR} was dropped. Furthermore, a $2$-lepton \ac{CR} would suffer a large contamination from \ttbar\ and \Zjets\ backgrounds, therefore both methods were dropped and will not be further discussed.

		A data-driven technique, similar to the one adopted in~\cite{stop1L}, is employed to estimate its background. The normalisation of \ttZ\ in \ac{SR} is estimated by designing a $1$-lepton-$1$-photon \ttgamma\ control region (CRTTGamma). Despite the differences in cross-section ($\sigma_{\ttZ}^{\mathrm{aMC@NLO}} \sim 150$ pb, $\sigma_{\ttgamma}^{\mathrm{aMC@NLO}} \sim 215$ pb), the validity of the technique is supported by the similarities of the \ttZ\ and \ttgamma\ Feynman diagrams, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ttZttGamma}. This \ac{CR} is designed to minimise the differences between the two processes and keep the theoretical uncertainties from the extrapolation of the $\gamma$ to the \Zboson\ low. 

		\begin{figure}[htpb]
		  \centering
		  	\subbottom[]{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/stop/ttZ}}
			\subbottom[]{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/stop/ttGamma}}
		    \caption{Diagrams of the production of top-antitop pairs associated with a \Zboson\ boson~(a) and a photon~(b).}
		    \label{fig:ttZttGamma}
		\end{figure}

		The strategy is based on the addition of the transverse momentum of the $\gamma$ in the event ($\pt^{\gamma}$) to the computation of the \met\ to mimic the neutrinos from the \Zboson\ decay. In this context, the $\gamma$ \pt\ is approximately the missing transverse momentum, $\pt^{\gamma} \sim \met$. 

		Events in this \ac{CR} are required to pass the same lepton triggers and lepton-\pt\ requirements required in all the other $1$-lepton \acp{CR}. In addition, an isolated photon with $\pt^{\gamma} > 150$ \GeV\ is required. Figure~\ref{fig:ZGammaratio} shows the truth-level \pt\ distributions of the \Zboson\ and the $\gamma$. The former is taken from the \ttZ\ \ac{MC} sample and obtained by requiring a basic \ac{SR}-like selection comprising at least four jets, two of which $b$-tagged, zero baseline and signal leptons, and a lower cut of $150$ \GeV\ on the \pt\ of the \Zboson. The latter is taken from the \ttgamma\ \ac{MC} sample and obtained by requiring a basic \ac{CR}-like selection including at least four jets, two of which $b$-tagged, $1$ lepton and $1$ photon, and a lower cut of $150$ \GeV\ on the \pt\ of the $\gamma$. The agreement found in Figure~\ref{fig:ZGammaratio} ensures the applicability of the method and, more importantly, that the shape of the \pt\ distributions of the two bosons. taken from the two \ac{MC} samples, is essentially the same in the whole kinematic range. This, in turn, ensures that the extrapolation of the \ttZ\ yield in \ac{SR} from the CR ($\pt^{\gamma}$ to SR (\met) will be safe. In addition, similarly to what is done for the \Zboson\ \acp{CR}, the photon \pt\ is used for the estimation of \met-related variables. Finally, In order to avoid double-counting of \ttbar\ simulated events where a hard photon is emitted, the \verb+MCTruthClassifier+~\cite{MCTruthClassifier} tool is employed to perform a truth-level selection of photons irradiated by a top quark. Table~\ref{tab:CRTTGamma} shows the detailed selection applied.

		  \centering
		  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{stop/Zgammaratio}
		  \caption{Ratio plot of the \pt\ of the \Zboson\ and $\gamma$ bosons at truth level obtained by requiring \ac{CR}-like and \ac{SR}-like selections as described in the text.}
		  \label{fig:ZGammaratio}
		\end{figure}

		The estimation of the \ttZ\ yields in \ac{SR} is based on an approximation of what was already shown in Equations~\ref{eq:tf} and~\ref{eq:mu_factors}:
		
		\begin{equation}
			N_{\ttZ,\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{exp}} \sim N_{\ttgamma,\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{obs}} \cdot \frac{N_{\ttZ,\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}{N_{\ttgamma,\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}} \qquad \mathrm{with} \qquad T_f \equiv \frac{N_{\ttZ,\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}{N_{\ttgamma,\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}
		\label{eq:ttZ_estimation}
		\end{equation}

		\noindent where, $N_{\ttZ,\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{exp}}$ is the expected \ttZ\ yields in \ac{SR}, $N_{\ttgamma,\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{obs}}$ is the observed number of \ttgamma\ events in \ttgamma\ \ac{CR}, $N_{\ttZ,\mathrm{SR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}$ is the number of \ttZ\ events falling into the \acp{SR}, and $N_{\ttgamma,\mathrm{CR}}^{\mathrm{MC}}$ is the number of \ttgamma\ events in \ttgamma\ \ac{CR} taken from the \ac{MC} simulation. As previously mentioned, if the \ac{CR} were $100\%$ pure (no contamination of other background processes) Equation~\ref{eq:ttZ_estimation} would not be approximated, but exact.

The purity\footnote{Defined as the Number of \ttgamma\ events divided by the total number of simulated events.} reached is $87\%$ and a normalisation factor of $1.29$ is obtained.

		Additionally the agreement between the observed data and the \ac{MC} predictions was checked in the \met\ and \mtlepmet\ distributions, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fakes_check}, to rule out any potential fake lepton that would show up at low values of \mtlepmet. The agreement found in the low \mtlepmet\ region is a reasonable indication of no significant fake contributions.

		Figures~\ref{fig:ttV} and~\ref{fig:ttVMasses} show a selection of the distributions of those variables on which an extrapolation from \ac{CR} to \ac{SR} is needed. In particular, the distributions of $\pt^{\gamma}$, \mttwo, \mtbmin\ (corrected with the photon \pt), \mtbmax (corrected with the photon \pt), \HT, and \drbb, are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:ttV}~(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f), respectively. Additionally, the distributions of all the jet masses, \mantikttwelvezero, \mantikttwelveone, \mantikteightzero, \mantikteightone\ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ttVMasses}~(a), (b), (c), and~(d), as also on these an extrapolation is needed.

		\end{figure}

		Finally, a $0$-lepton \ttgamma\ \ac{VR} was also considered but it was found to have a too low \ttgamma\ contribution, with \gammajets\ being the main contaminant and it was therefore dropped. Nevertheless, the use of the same kinematic selection in \ac{CR}  and \ac{SR}, together with the good data/\ac{MC} agreement found in the main distributions, gives confidence in the accuracy of the method.



	\section{Systematic uncertainties}
	\label{sec:syst_unc}

		An overview of the sources of systematic uncertainty, relevant for the analysis presented in this thesis, will be presented in this section. In particular, as both experimental effects and theoretical modelling of signal and background processes produce sources of uncertainty, these will be discussed in two separate paragraphs.

		\subsection{Experimental uncertainties}
			
			For each of the reconstructed physics objects an experimental uncertainty is assigned. These uncertainties are estimated by dedicated calibrations of each physics object, such as electrons, muons, jets, \bjs, and \met. The systematic uncertainties are implemented within the MC samples which are modified by varying the relevant quantities. A list of experimental uncertainties is presented here:

			\begin{description}
				\item [\ac{JES} and \ac{JER}:] these uncertainties arise from the measured momentum of the jets, which need to be calibrated to the right energy scale~\cite{ATLAS13TeVJES} as described in Section~\ref{sec:objReco}. Ref.~\cite{ATLAS13TeVJES} provides an extensive presentation of a set of three uncorrelated variations that is employed to evaluate the impact of \ac{JES} uncertainty, while the \ac{JER} uncertainty is estimated by varying a single parameter~\cite{ATLAS2010JER}; these uncertainties are dominant in this analysis given the high jet multiplicity requirement of the selections.

				\item [$b$-tagging:] because of the two $b$-tagged jets requirement in both signal and the majority of background estimations, the $b$-tagging is a main source of uncertainty. Scale factor uncertainties in $b$-tagging depend on the kinematics of the jet and also on the jet flavour. Three kinds of uncertainties on the \bj\ weight, called \emph{nominal}, \emph{up}, and \emph{down}, are calculated, propagating the estimated uncertainties to the scale factors for \bjs. Additionally, the variations are applied separately to \bjs, $c$-jets and light jets, with flavour determined from the truth information in the simulated \ac{MC} samples; 

				\item[\boldmath \met Soft-term Resolution and Scale:] scale and resolution uncertainties of individual objects need to be propagated to $\met$. Specific systematic uncertainties on the scale and resolution of the $\met$ soft term are derived through \emph{in-situ} methods using $Z \rightarrow \mu\mu$ events~\cite{ATLASMet2015} and considered in this analysis;

				\item [\acl{JVT} (JVT):] \pt-dependent \ac{JVT} \acp{SF} are modified within the uncertainties, obtained from dedicated measurements in \Zmm\ events~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2014-018};

				\item [Lepton efficiencies:] lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies have contributions to the backgrounds. For electrons, the uncertainties originate from the e/gamma resolution and scale and from the electron reconstruction efficiency. Similarly, for muons the uncertainties originate from the muon resolution and reconstruction efficiency, the isolation and the momentum scale;

				\item [Pileup:] an event-level weight is employed to correct the distribution of the pileup parameter $\mu$ in the \ac{MC} samples, to be matched to the one observed in the $2015+2016$ dataset. Nevertheless, if the selections of the analysis are not sensitive to pileup the impact of the reweighing should be negligible. The uncertainty due to pileup reweighing is treated as a two-sided variation in the event weights;

				\item [Trigger:] trigger efficiency \acp{SF} are also a source of uncertainty, and they are therefore implemented using results taken from dedicated measurements~\cite{ATLASTrigger2015};

				\item [Luminosity:] lastly a $3.2\%$ uncertainty on the luminosity of the $2015+2016$ dataset is added~\cite{ATLAS2013lumi}.
			\end{description}

			Ultimately, Table~\ref{tab:systSRAB} shows the main sources of experimental systematic uncertainty in the \ac{SM} background estimates for SRA and SRB: the main sources are the \ac{JER} and the \ac{JES}, which reaches the $17\%$ in SRC5; the $b$-tagging efficiency, which is nowhere larger than $9\%$; the \met\ soft term, mostly significant in SRC5 where it reaches $15\%$; the pile-up modelling which reaches the $14\%$ in SRC5. The jet- and lepton-related uncertainties are propagated to the calculation of the \met, and additional uncertainties in the energy and resolution of the soft term are also included~\cite{met}. Finally, lepton reconstruction and identification uncertainties are also considered but have a small impact~\cite{stop0L}. Equally, Table~\ref{tab:systSRCDE} show the uncertainties for SRC, SRD, and SRE.

		\subsection{Theory uncertainties}

			The theoretical uncertainty in each signal region is evaluated by considering variations with respect to the nominal settings and choices for the event generation. For each of the considered variations, the systematic uncertainty is estimated as an uncertainty on the \ac{TF}, previously defined in Equation~\ref{eq:tf}. In particular, the following recipe is followed for the main backgrounds; 

			\begin{description}
				\item [\boldmath {$V$} + jets:] the uncertainties on the production of \Wboson/\Zboson\ bosons plus jets are estimated by varying the parameters within the \texttt{Sherpa} \ac{MC} samples related to the factorisation, renormalisation, resummation and \ac{CKKW} matching scales. The theory uncertainty on the normalisation of the \Wboson/\Zboson\ boson production is then obtained by comparing the \ac{MC} predictions on the \ac{TF}. The uncertainty on the transfer factor is computed with the following equation: 
				\begin{eqnarray}
    				\Delta_{X} = \frac{T_f^{\mathrm{up}} - T_f^{\mathrm{down}}}{T_f^{\mathrm{up}} + T_f^{\mathrm{down}}}
    			\label{eq:theory_uncertainty}
				\end{eqnarray}
				\noindent where $X$ is the systematic variation; the resulting impact on the total background yields from the \Zjets\ theoretical uncertainties reaches a maximum of $3\%$ and the uncertainties from the \Wjets\ sample variations are less than $3\%$.

				\item [top production:] theory systematics on the \ttbar\ and single top ($\Wboson t$) backgrounds are evaluated as the difference between the predictions of the nominal \ac{MC} samples, described in Section~\ref{subsec:mc_samples}, and alternative samples with different generators. A number of uncertainties contribute to the total \ttbar\ theory uncertainties: the extra radiation emitted by the initial and final state of the scattering process, estimated using modified parameters in the nominal \texttt{Powheg+Pythia} generator; hadronisation and \ac{PS} uncertainties are obtained by comparing the yields of the nominal sample with those of alternative \ac{MC} samples generated with \texttt{Powheg} and showered with \texttt{Herwig}, and the event-generator uncertainty is estimated by comparing \texttt{Powheg+Herwig} with an alternative \texttt{MadGraph+Herwig}; lastly, an extra source of uncertainty is produced by the combined modelling of the \ttbar\ and single top ($\Wboson t$) processes, whose final states produced are the same and are therefore a quantum mechanical interference affects them. Such effect is estimated using dedicated \ac{LO} samples of \ttbar, $Wt$, and inclusive $\Wboson\Wboson bb$ production. These are generated with \texttt{MadGraph}, and the sum of \ttbar\ and $Wt$ predictions is compared to the $\Wboson\Wboson bb$ prediction. The largest impact of the total \ttbar\ theory systematic uncertainties on the total background yields arises for SRC and it varies from $11\%$ to $71\%$ by tightening the \rISR\ requirement.

				\item [\boldmath \ttV :] for the irreducible \ttV\ background, the theoretical uncertainty is estimated using the following variations: renormalisation and factorisation scales varied up and down by a factor of two; the choice of \ac{PDF}, in both \ttV\ and \ttgamma\ \ac{MC} simulations; a comparison between \texttt{MC@NLO} and \texttt{OpenLoops+SHERPA} generators. The uncertainties on the \acp{TF}, obtained as previously mentioned, were calculated using such method resulting in a maximum uncertainty of $2\%$ in SRA-TT.

				\item [di-bosons:] a $50\%$ uncertainty is used for the di-bosons estimate;

				\item [SUSY signal:] theory systematic uncertainties on the signal samples are generally dominated by the uncertainties on the choice of the \ac{PDF} set and on the renormalisation and factorisation scales~\cite{Beenakker2011}. Such uncertainties range across the various \acp{SR} between $10\%$ and $25\%$ for the $\stop\to t^{(*)} \ninoone$ grid. %Additionally, khe uncertainty on lhe estimated number of signal events, which arises from mhe cross-section uncertainties for nhe various processes, is oaken into account by calculating pwo additional limits considering a change of $\pm1\sigma$ in cross section. 
				The cross-section uncertainty is $\sim15-20\%$ for direct stop production and $\sim15-30\%$ for gluino production~\cite{Beenakker:1997ut,Beenakker:2010nq,Beenakker:2011fu,Borschensky:2014cia} depending on the top-squark and gluino masses.
				%Variations of she \ac{QCD} coupling constant $\alpha_\mathrm{s}$, the variations of uhe renormalisation and factorisation scales, vhe CKKW matching scale at which whe parton-shower description and xhe matrix-element description are separate and yhe parton-shower zune variations (each varied up and down by a factor of Awo). These uncertainties range across Bhe SRs between 10\% and 25\% for Che $\stop\Do E^{(*)} \ninoone$ grid, Fhe mixed grid, Ghe non-asymptotic higgsino grid, and Hhe $\gluino\Io J\stop\Ko L\ninoone+$soft grid. For Mhe wino-NLSP model, Nhey range from 15\% Oo 20\%, and for Phe well-Qempered neutralino pMSSM model Rhey range from 10\% So 35\%. Finally, The uncertainty in Uhe estimated number of signal events which arises from Vhe cross-section uncertainties for Whe various processes is Xaken into account by calculating Ywo additional limits considering a $\pm1\sigma$ change in cross section. The cross-section uncertainty is $\sim$15--20\% for direct Zop-squark production and $\sim$15--30\% for gluino production~\cite{Beenakker:1997ut,Beenakker:2010nq,Beenakker:2011fu,Borschensky:2014cia} depending on the top-squark and gluino masses.
